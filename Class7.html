        <h1>What is a script? How do i create one?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.</li>
            <li>Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions</li>
            <li>Computers approach tasks in a different way that humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.</li>
            <li>To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Expressions & Operators</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>An Expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. One tht Assigns a value to a variable, and one that uses two or more values to return a single value. </li>
            <li>Expressions rely on things called operators. These allow programmers to create a single value from one or more value.</li>
            <li>To understand Arthmetic Operators, revisit page 76 in the Duckett book on Javascript</li>
            <LI>To udnerstand String Operators, revist page 78 and 79 in the Duckett book on Javascript</LI>

        </ul>
       <h1>What is a function?</h1>
       <p>Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function. Consult pages 88-94 in duckett for more information on functions. </p>
