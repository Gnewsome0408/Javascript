        <h1>Introduction to Javascript</h1>
        <p>What are some things to keep in mind when getting started with JS?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is best to keep Javascriptcode in its own Javascript File. Javascript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.</li>
            <li>The HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the Javascript file (rather like the link) element can be used to load a CSS file).</li>
            <li>If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the Javascriptwill not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Basic Javascript instructios</h1>
        <p>Understanding basic scripts and intructions</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe</li>
            <li>Scripts contain very precise instrucitons. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.</li>
            <li>Variables are used to temporarily store pieces on information used in the script.</li>
            <LI>Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.</LI>
            <li>Javascriptdistinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).</li>
            <li>Expressions evaluate into a single value.</li>
            <li>expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now lets add some examples of Javascript!</p>
        <p>
            <button onclick="alert('Use command oneclick and = alert');">click me</button> This button is an example of inline JS.
        </p>
    </body>
    <script src="class6.js"> </script>
